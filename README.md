## Forecast the National Passenger Traffic in China

China is the country with the largest traffic passenger scale around the world. It could affect national economy through tourism industry, transportation, communications and so on. Operators in industries like trains, airlines, hotels are especially interested in this data. Thus forecast on the national passenger traffic is meaningful. However, it is tricky to build effective forecast models because of complex external factors such as COVID-19, which, obviously, has a strong impact on traffic passenger. Nonetheless, since the forecast is important, it is worthwhile to give a try.
